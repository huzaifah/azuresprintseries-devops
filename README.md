# Azure Sprint Series - DevOps
## Introduction
[Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com) and [Aware Group](https://www.awaregroup.com) proudly present the Azure Sprint Series: DevOps challenge. This event is designed with [5 self-paced challenges](#Challenges) that will guide you through many of the features that [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com) has to offer. We encourage you to explore, experiment and make use of the coaches provided during the event.

Each challenge represents a specific area of the [DevOps lifecycle](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/overview/what-is-devops/). At the end of each challenge, you must demonstrate to your coach what you have done before moving on. This is also a great opportunity to ask any additional questions you may have.

## Scenario
You and your team have been engaged by an animal adoption agency, **Tailspin Animal Adoptions (TAA)** to take over building and maintaining an existing codebase for their public facing website. During the quoting phase, TAA identified the following requirements to add more visibility and governance to the development lifecycle in the following ways:

* Better visibility into planned work items
* Centralised code management
* Consistent builds, tests and releases
* Integration with existing internal tools (Microsoft Teams)

Over the next two days, you will modernise the development lifecycle for Tailspin Animal Adoptions through the use of Azure DevOps!

## Coaches
Coaches will be available to teams during the event. Feel free to ask questions, request help and demonstrate completed tasks. Coaches are allowed to answer questions and provide guidance to the correct documentation; however they will not give the answer right away. These are designed as challenges for a reason!

## Important Links
* **Microsoft Azure DevOps ([dev.azure.com/azuresprint-devops](https://dev.azure.com/azuresprint-devops))**<br>Azure DevOps empowers developers to plan, manage, build and release project assets. This is the primary tool we will use for the challenges. 
* **Microsoft Azure Portal ([portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com))**<br/>Azure is the cloud platform where we will be deploying our micro-services and associated components.
* **Microsoft Teams ([teams.microsoft.com](https://teams.microsoft.com))**<br/>Teams is the tool you will use to collaborate with your team. The challenges will demonstrate how you can integrate Teams with Azure DevOps for an integrated experience.
* **Microsoft Outlook ([mail.office365.com](https://mail.office365.com))**<br/>Outlook (part of Office 365) will be used to demonstrate email integration with Azure DevOps.

## Next Steps
* Introduce yourself to your coach 
* Upon receiving your login details, open [Microsoft Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com) and introduce yourself to your team on the General channel. It's a good idea to introduce what you do for work and something you enjoy outside of work.
